I'm building a botnet that uses rpc protocol and uses bridges and queues to run processes represented in map form. these processes are passed to functions that emulate rpcs by touching and building binaries that are run and pass back data to be used elsewhere. its very complicated i need like 2 people for the workload. the concept is not hard to grasp and it will be very fun brainstorming
